            <h2>About</h2>
                <p>The gameplay of Snake Eater is similar to that of previous games in the Metal Gear Solid series. 
                Snake, controlled by the player, must move undetected through a hostile, enemy-filled environment</p>
            <h2>Merchendise</h2>
                    <p>Despite the fundamental similarities, Snake Eater introduces many new aspects of gameplay not present in previous Metal Gear games,
                       including camouflage, a new hand-to-hand combat system called "close quarters combat" or "CQC", a stamina gauge, and an injury-and-treatment system.[13][17]</p>
